The project was made as a test project to help me upload data to my Firebase database so I can use it in another project.

The project still needs to get edited for the styling and also for the possibility to delete data, some more tweaks are necessary.

you can name a new collection and upload files from your JSON file to the collection or you can append data to an already existing one
